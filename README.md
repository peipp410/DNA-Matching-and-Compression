# DNA matching and compressing

Our project mainly implements algorithms concerning string matching and compression. To gain more information about the usage of our function, please turn to our manual. Thanks!

**Usage**:

First please call make to generate the executable file and then run ./bin/match_compr.static to start program.

`m`: Match the DNA sequence with pattern strings.

`p l r`: Check whether the substring (from location l to r) is palindrome.

`c pos ch`: Modify the nucleotide at location pos to ch.

`h`: Print the huffman code.

`q`: Quit.
